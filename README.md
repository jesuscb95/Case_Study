# Google Data Analytics Case Study
	Introduction

Hi My name is Jesus Carreon, I will perform a case study doing many real world tasks of a junior data analyst, the name of the company is Cyclistic, where you will get insight of the key stakeholders and team members.
I will answer key business questions using the steps of the analysis process to achieve the business goal
I am working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. 

	Scenario

The director of marketing of Cyclistic, Lily Moreno, believes that the company’s future growth depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Hence, the marketing analyst team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the analytics team could be able to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

Three questions will guide the future marketing campaign:

*1.How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

*2.Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

*3.How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

I have been assigned by Moreno the first question. 

	The Ask Phase
* A statement of the business task: 

The Cyclistic team has concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. So, we want to design marketing strategies and a campaign that helps us converting casual riders into annual members. 

* My key stakeholders are: 

1-Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and my manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels. She is the most important stakeholder

2- Cyclistic executive team: The idea of Lily Moreno is to showcase why annual members and casual riders differ from each other and our job is to demonstrate why the data should be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data vizualizations

This means that you won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
